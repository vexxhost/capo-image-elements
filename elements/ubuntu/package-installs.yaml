# NODE(fitbeard): Uninstalling 'linux-firmware' and 'snapd'

linux-firmware:
    uninstall: true
snapd:
    uninstall: true
# NOTE(fitbeard): 'diskimage-builder' does not support conditional element dependencies,
#                  so we use this fork of original 'ubuntu' element with removed 'dkms'
#                  element from dependency list. This alone saves us 200Mb from final image size.
